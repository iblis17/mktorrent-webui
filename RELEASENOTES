Notes:
The fifth beta release of MkTorrent WebUI.
This is an extensive rewrite from the svn version of mktorrent to the SourceForge version (I don't understand why they were so different.)
Supports all of the options MkTorrent supports.
Fairly untested.

Installation:
Just extract index.php, name it whatever.
The folder torrents are saved to needs to be writable by the webserver user, for a default apache install that is www-data.
